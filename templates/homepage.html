    <h1 class="text-center">WELCOME TO KN MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p>
            The KN movie recommendation system is also the one that offers you suggestions based on the movies you watch, like, vote for, comment on.
            After entering the name of a movie you've seen and liked before, it gives you movie recommendations similar to that one.
            These recommendations are made using certain filtering methods.
            The most commonly used filtering methods are Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.
            We have two different filtering methods.
            You will choose the most suitable one among these methods and get a movie recommendation accordingly.

           <p>Content-based advice is the system that trusts users to resemble items when suggesting items.
            For example, when a user likes a movie, the system finds and recommends movies with features that are more similar to the movie the user likes.
            It is the system that measures the similarity of movies according to their keywords, genres, directors and recommends similar films to you.

    <div class="box2">
           <p> This filtering method is to find similar movies instead of similar users and then recommend similar movies that the user has in their past preferences.
            This is carried out by finding each pair of items rated / viewed / liked / clicked by the same user, then measuring the similarity of those rated/viewed/liked/clicked among all users who rated/watched/liked/clicked both, and finally made recommendations based on similarity scores.
